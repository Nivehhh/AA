This project is part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree by Udacity.

Key Objectives
Identify whether pet images are of dogs, regardless of breed accuracy.
Classify the breed for images identified as dogs.
Compare CNN models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) to find the best fit for objectives 1 and 2.
Evaluate time efficiency and explore alternative solutions for a balance between accuracy and performance.
